# osu!Cloud
Cloud save like app for osu, that tracks the downloaded maps between different devices.
It won't download the maps automatically, only show them inside the app, where you can click on a link to redirect to the beatmap's webpage to download it.

There will be **no active cloud server** for this app. The app will have an option to use own personal backend server or connect to google drive by a service account to save data.

## Work in progress
I don't really have much time for this. It will be finished...someday.
